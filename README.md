# discord-nlp-smily-bot

A discord bot to analyse messages and react to them with an emoji.

This code is not very easy to read, and is intended for a friend to mess about with on a discord server.

I took a large portions of code from [here](https://github.com/anuragbhattacharjee/discord-nlp-smily-bot) and [here](https://github.com/huggingface/torchMoji)

Oh, also the code was only tested with Ubuntu 18.04 and i think macOS Sierra by Huggingface

You will also need to add a file called **`.env`** with this inside:
```
DISCORD_TOKEN='###########################################################'
```
:)
