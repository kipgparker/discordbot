# discord-nlp-smily-bot

A discord bot to analyse messages and react to them with an emoji.

This code is not very easy to read, and is intended for a friend to mess about with on a discord server.

I took a large portions of code from [here](https://github.com/anuragbhattacharjee/discord-nlp-smily-bot) and [here](https://github.com/huggingface/torchMoji)
